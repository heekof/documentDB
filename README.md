# Simple Document DB

## Project Overview

This is a personal learning project aimed at creating a simple document database engine in Python. The main goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of database management systems, JSON handling, and Python programming.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main Python files:

1. `simple_document_db.py`: Contains the [SimpleDocumentDB](cci:2://file:///home/bendrisj/documentDB/simple_document_db.py:13:0-149:19) class, which is the core of the database engine.
2. `json_handler.py`: Houses the [JSONHandler](cci:2://file:///home/bendrisj/documentDB/json_handler.py:8:0-55:55) class, responsible for JSON-related operations.
3. `main.py`: The entry point of the application, demonstrating usage of the database engine.

## Key Features

- Document insertion and retrieval
- Basic querying capabilities
- JSON data handling
- File-based storage system

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, you can learn about:

1. Database Design: Understanding how to structure a simple database system.
2. JSON Handling: Working with JSON data in Python.
3. File I/O: Managing file operations for data persistence.
4. Error Handling: Implementing custom exceptions and error management.
5. Code Organization: Structuring a Python project with multiple modules.

## Future Improvements

To enhance your learning experience, consider implementing these features:

1. Advanced Querying: Add support for complex queries (regex, comparisons).
2. Indexing: Implement a basic indexing system to improve query performance.
3. Concurrency: Add support for multiple simultaneous database operations.
4. Data Validation: Implement schema validation for documents.
5. Transactions: Add support for atomic operations across multiple documents.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `main.py` to see the database in action
3. Explore the code in `simple_document_db.py` and `json_handler.py`
4. Start implementing new features or optimizations!
